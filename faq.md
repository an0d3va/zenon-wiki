# Incentivized Testnet

## SwapDrop

### Q: Can I still participate in SwapDrop and receive PP rewards?
Yes, but only if you had ZNN on a legacy address at block 1,331,331.

For more information about the Swap Drop event see <https://medium.com/@zenon.network/swapdrop-event-october-1st-bd99964589aa>

### Q: Does participating in SwapDrop affect the ZNN in my legacy wallet?
No.

SwapDrop is an incentivized test for the real swap for Alphanet. As stated at: <https://medium.com/@zenon.network/swapdrop-event-october-1st-bd99964589aa>
> The legacy assets (ZNN and QSR, if applicable) will be swapped into testnet coins (tZNN and tQSR, if applicable) without affecting the legacy network balances.
