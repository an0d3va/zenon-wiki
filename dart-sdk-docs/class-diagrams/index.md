# Zenon Dart SDK Class Diagrams

Class diagrams showing the structure of the Zenon Dart SDK. The [simplified](simplified.md) diagram gives a broad overview of the exported classes without any functions or fields listed, for clarity. The [complete](complete.md) diagram shows every class with all its associated functions and fields. It is very complex but the vector graphic format allows zooming to any level of detail. The table of contents lists some further sections which have been isolated for clearer display on their own.

These diagrams were generated with the [dcdg](https://pub.dev/packages/dcdg) package and rendered with the [PlantUML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml) VS Code plugin.
