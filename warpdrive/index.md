WarpDrive is the first virtual global hackathon designed to engage the community and accelerate the rapid growth of the ecosystem.

The WarpDrive event is incentivized using Plasma Points and serves as the foundation for the Alphanet Accelerator, where the winning ideas of WarpDrive will have a tremendous opportunity for acessing funds in a decentralized way.

Explore. Build. Deliver.
